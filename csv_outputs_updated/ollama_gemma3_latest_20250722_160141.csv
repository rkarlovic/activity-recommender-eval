**Recommendation:** I highly recommend checking out the restaurant near the museum of Apoxyomenos – it’s known for serving traditional Lošinj cuisine, including the ""pod teću"" lamb, which is a local favorite. They’ll likely be offering delicious slow-roasted red meat dishes perfect for a rainy day. 

**Explanation:** Although it’s raining, you enjoy warm, savory food, and this restaurant is specifically highlighted for its traditional Lošinj cuisine and barbecue-style meats. It’s a great way to indulge your preferences despite the weather!

**Recommendation:** I suggest visiting “Lošinj” – a restaurant known for traditional Lošinj cuisine. While they offer a wide range of dishes, they *do* prepare a delicious “pod teću” lamb, which you can request without the pasta, ensuring it aligns with your low-carb diet. It’s a classic Lošinj dish and conveniently located near the waterfront.

**Why this is a good fit:** It directly answers your question about roast beef, respects your dietary preferences (low-carb), and caters to your enjoyment of classic foods. Despite the rain, you can still enjoy a delicious meal in a charming setting.

Given that it’s a humid 27°C, a traditional stand-up comedy night might not be the most comfortable experience. However, knowing you enjoy tech gadgets and travel vlogging, I suggest checking out the *Lošinj Museum*. They often have exhibits on the island's history and culture, which could provide interesting content for your vlogs! Plus, the museum is indoors, offering a welcome respite from the heat. 

You can find more information about events and the museum here: www.island-losinj.com 

Would you like me to look for any tech shops on the island to browse gadgets while you're there?",Other,-1,,,,,,Culture
