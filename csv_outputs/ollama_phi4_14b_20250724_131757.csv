Given the sunny weather at 25¬∞C and light winds, you can enjoy your meal outdoors near the waterfront, where the ambiance is both relaxing and scenic. The restaurant's proximity to the museum of Apoxyomenos also allows for an enriching post-dinner stroll if you're interested in exploring local culture.

If cauliflower crust pizza isn't available or if you'd like a twist, try asking if they can customize their offerings with your other low-carb favorites like egg muffins. Their flexibility and location make it a delightful spot to enjoy both food and surroundings while respecting your dietary choices. Enjoy your meal at Kredo bar! üçïüåû
