To accommodate your love for nature walks and scenic drives, you can enjoy a leisurely stroll around the waterfront after your meal, soaking up the sunny 25°C weather with pleasant 10 km/h winds – perfect for your dislike of loud noises.

If you're interested in a cultural experience, the restaurant is conveniently located near the Museum of Apoxyomenos, allowing you to combine your culinary adventure with an appreciation for local history and art afterward. 

Please note that while Artatore Restoran is known for its traditional fare, they might be able to adapt some dishes to meet vegan requirements; it's always a good idea to communicate your dietary needs directly when you make a reservation or upon arrival. Enjoy exploring the flavors of Lošinj!"

Although not strictly a salty meat dish, it's a flavorful and savory option that aligns with your preference for salty flavors. 

Please note that while they do offer seafood, the kitchen is likely to be accommodating if you inquire about vegan alternatives or modifications. The restaurant's cozy atmosphere provides a tranquil environment, which should suit your preference for peaceful surroundings.

The sunny weather of 25°C with a gentle 10 km/h wind makes an alfresco meal even more appealing. Pair your grilled fish with some salty snacks from local markets, aligning with your dietary preference for fish and simple, traditional fare.

Konoba Podrum is well-known for its traditional Lošinj dishes, including their delicious ""lošinj 'pod teću' lamb,"" which they prepare with classic methods. Although seafood is abundant on the menu due to Lošinj's bounty of shrimps, seashells, and other seafood, you might be interested in their roasted meat options. 

Remember, while you can indulge in local specialties like aromatic gnocchi or black cuttlefish risotto, given your preference for comfort food and roasted meat, I suggest inquiring about any available roasted fish or non-spicy meat dishes that align with your dietary needs.

Enjoy your visit to Konoba Podrum, savoring the peaceful atmosphere while delighting in the flavors of Lošinj's coastal cuisine!"

For prime bird-watching areas, consider visiting the Čikat Bay region where you can enjoy both nature and comfort, as it's near a large campsite offering scenic terraces for observing local wildlife without excessive driving.

Considering today’s windy weather at 21°C with a breeze of 25 km/h, outdoor birdwatching might be more brisk than ideal. Therefore, I recommend starting your day with an early dinner to warm up, perhaps at one of the local restaurants that offer your preferred fish-based dishes like grilled vegetables or miso soup and olives. 

After your meal, visit the nearby Mali Plaza or another open space in Čikat for birdwatching. If the wind proves too strong, you could also explore the local botanical gardens or the Lošinj Museum, both of which align with your lifestyle preferences and are likely to offer tranquil environments.

Remember to pack appropriately for the weather and consider bringing binoculars if you don't have them. Enjoy your time in this rich bird-watching haven!"

It's an excellent activity to enjoy moderate waves while aligning with your eco-activism interests as it's a low-impact water sport that allows you to connect with the serene environment of Lošinj’s beautiful bays. 

The gentle 15 km/h wind will enhance your SUP experience, offering the perfect conditions for balancing and gliding over the water. Moreover, SUMartin is situated close to Veli Lošinj, giving you easy access to some of the island's most stunning coastal spots. 

While you're there, you might also enjoy the picturesque sunsets and consider capturing drone photographs of the scenic landscapes – another hobby that aligns with your interests. 

For a complete day out, pair your SUP session with a pescatarian meal at a local eatery, perhaps featuring grilled fish or a quinoa salad, accompanied by a refreshing green smoothie. Enjoy your time on Lošinj!"

This scenic spot offers tranquil surroundings and is perfect for quiet contemplation or birdwatching. Although the current weather is sunny, you mentioned a preference for cooler conditions; however, Maloje provides a gentle sea breeze that might suit your comfort level better than the direct sunlight. There are no direct café options within this nature reserve, but you can pack your vegetarian favorites like mushroom risotto or minestrone soup and enjoy them amidst the serene environment. For a more structured experience, consider joining one of Mare Mare's guided hikes focusing on local flora and fauna; this would align with both your interest in gardening and birdwatching.

The restaurant is close to the Museum of Apoxyomenos and offers a variety of seafood options, including what could potentially be your coveted grilled seafood paella (though it's known more for its traditional Lošinj specialties like black cuttlefish risotto, shrimps, and Kvarner shrimp soup). Their menu also includes other dishes made with local ingredients that align with your dietary preference for fish and rice.

The weather is currently windy with a pleasant temperature of 21°C, making it a comfortable time for an outdoor meal amidst the beautiful island scenery. Though there's a strong breeze, you'll likely enjoy dining on their patio, soaking in the sea views while savoring classic Croatian flavors.

If the wind becomes too much of a hassle or if you prefer an indoor setting for your meal, remember that Lošinj offers a variety of cozy taverns and bistros like ""Pod Obala"" or ""Zora,"" where you can still relish local specialties under covered areas. 

Enjoy your culinary adventure on the island, where you'll likely find dishes prepared with fresh local ingredients such as lamb, seafood, homemade pasta, and olive oil, all infused with herbs from Lošinj's lush gardens – a true delight for food lovers seeking hearty, traditional fare."

While the current windy weather at 21°C might not be ideal for outdoor dining, consider enjoying a cozy meal indoors with a view of the Mediterranean through a window, perhaps while engaging in your love for classic literature or pen pal writing. 

One place to start could be exploring establishments known for their commitment to traditional recipes, which aligns with Lošinj's culinary philosophy. Although specific restaurants highlighting vegetarian eggplant stew aren't explicitly mentioned, the island's focus on local and seasonal produce suggests that such a dish could be available, possibly adapted to suit your vegetarian diet, perhaps incorporating goat cheese as per your preferences. 

For a more direct recommendation, I'd suggest inquiring at restaurants like ""Primo Lussignano,"" known for their seafood but also potentially open to preparing a hearty pumpkin soup or eggplant stew given the island's culinary heritage. Remember to call ahead to ensure they can cater to your vegetarian needs with dishes like those you mentioned, such as eggplant stew or pumpkin soup.

While the weather is currently rainy, this cozy spot will be perfect for enjoying some warming local fare. They specialize in preparing dishes with fresh seafood, olive oil, and herbs from the island - all key elements of Lošinj's cuisine. 

Given your preference for 'fried rice' from your dietary list, I suggest you try their ""Lošinj-style Fried Rice"" (if available), which incorporates local seafood and perhaps some ginger tea to complement your meal. If not, they offer a traditional ""Pod Teću"" Lamb dish, though it might be a bit richer than fried rice. 

For an additional touch of your interests, consider pairing your meal with a visit to the nearby used bookstore afterward, perhaps picking up a memoir or a cookbook to explore more regional Croatian recipes for future home experiments. Enjoy your culinary adventure on Lošinj despite the weather!"

This restaurant, located in Mali Lošinj, is known for its modern-day gastronomic wonders and offers a range of delightful options that align with your dietary preferences.

This charming restaurant is located near the museum of Apoxyomenos and offers stunning views of the sea with covered terraces where you can enjoy the soothing sounds of the waves – perfect for your preference of quiet surroundings.

Although today's weather is sunny, their menu boasts traditional Croatian dishes including grilled sardines prepared in the classic manner, which should satisfy your love for 'grilled fish.' The restaurant also provides a peaceful atmosphere, free from busy traffic and LED screens, aligning with your preferences.

As for your dietary restriction of only eating fish, they offer a variety including grilled sardines and sea bass, both freshly caught and perfect for your palate. This location also gives you the opportunity to enjoy the local flavors and aromas typical of Lošinj’s rich cuisine without needing to venture far from your preferred quiet environments.

Enjoy your meal with a side of leek soup, as it's a common Croatian dish that might pique your interest if you're looking for something different from your regular choices. Remember to ask about their specialties – they are known for preserving the traditional cooking methods, which aligns well with your appreciation for local customs and your diet restrictions.

If the soft drizzle weather you prefer were present instead, I would suggest exploring indoor activities such as visiting art galleries featuring watercolor paintings or engaging in postcard writing at a serene café, but given today's sunny conditions, an outdoor lunch at Sabbia Bianca seems ideal."

This activity will not only give you a chance to relish more traditional flavors but also enjoy the tranquility of the island as the evening sets in, something that suits your preference for 'evening walks to the bakery'. 

If you'd rather avoid going out due to the humid weather, I suggest looking into local artisanal food shops or markets where you might find pre-made veal schnitzel or other Lošinj specialties to take back to your accommodation for a private dining experience. You can complement this with some of the locally produced olive oil and jams, perhaps picking them up during one of your 'bookstore browsing' sessions where you might stumble upon cookbooks featuring Lošinj recipes. 

Remember, Lošinj is known for its aromatic teas and liqueurs, so if you're interested, you could also explore visiting the Aroma Island Garden workshop post-meal to sample some unique local beverages, catering to your interest in 'pipe carving' and 'vintage radios' through the island's rich cultural heritage."

When in Lošinj during colder months, you might enjoy cozying up with thermos coffee by a fire pit while savoring this hearty meal. Pair it with some local bread pudding for dessert – an excellent choice to warm up on a chilly day.

If the snow isn't present as expected, no worries! The island’s charm extends indoors too. You can explore traditional taverns or participate in cooking classes that showcase Lošinj's culinary heritage, learning to prepare these delicious dishes yourself while enjoying the company of fellow food enthusiasts.

Remember, the Lošinj Cuisine Festival is another great opportunity to immerse yourself in the island’s flavors and traditions, making it an excellent event to consider if your visit overlaps with its dates. Enjoy your meal!"

As for your snack cravings, while La Tagliinatella doesn't serve fried pickles or loaded nachos directly, their inventive approach to traditional Croatian flavors might inspire them in the future. For now, they do offer a range of local cheeses and cured meats that could be a great substitute for your preferred snacks, paired with some fresh Lošinj olive oil.

To complement your meal, you might consider exploring nearby coffee shops or bistros for a caramel latte, as the island's local produce lends itself beautifully to sweet treats – particularly those made from citrus fruits, which are a hallmark of Lošinj. 

While you're there, take in some graffiti art or perhaps enjoy a nostalgia playlist on your phone while savoring the unique tastes of this beautiful island.

Not only does it fit your request for a tavern with a stunning view right by the sea (as per point 3), but it also matches your dietary preference of fish-based dishes. 

Although their menu doesn't explicitly list ""grilled sardine bruschetta,"" given their emphasis on traditional Lošinj cuisine and fresh seafood, I'm confident they can prepare this for you upon request. You might want to call ahead to confirm (contact details from point 5: Artatore, Artatore 132, +385 51 232 932).

Considering the humid weather with a temperature of 27°C and a gentle breeze, dining outside on their spacious covered terrace would be delightful. It aligns perfectly with your enjoyment of zen interiors and soothing sounds of sea waves. Enjoy your evening swim post-meal to complete this tranquil experience. 

Please note that while the weather is pleasant, there's a chance of humidity which you might want to factor into your plans, perhaps opting for lighter clothing or bringing a small fan if necessary."

Lošinj cuisine is rich with flavours and aromas of the 
Mediterranean and the dishes are still prepared in the 
same way as they have always been - in the traditional way!","Weather: windy, temperature 21°C, Wind 25 km/h","Given your vegetarian preference with a penchant for unique flavors, I'd recommend ""Artatore,"" located at Artatore 132, as it's one of the few places on Lošinj that caters to diverse dietary needs while incorporating local ingredients. Although they're known for their traditional Croatian fare, you might be able to request a vegetarian twist on dishes like ""pod teću"" (cooked under a bell-shaped lid) which infuses food with herbs from Lošinj, or perhaps an innovative take on seafood-free specialties using whitefish or olive oil.

Considering today's stormy twilight weather, you might enjoy the ambiance of Artatore, which is situated near the Museum of Apoxyomenos and overlooks the waterfront – a perfect blend of your interest in experimental music and old signage, as well as your love for museum hopping. 

Although the weather might be a bit blustery at 21°C with 25 km/h winds, it could add to the charm of an intimate evening meal where you can savor the subtle, local flavors without the usual Mediterranean sun. Remember to inquire about dishes that align with your preferences such as corn soup or beet fries, perhaps asking if they can create a special using pepper jack quesadillas' spirit with available local cheeses and vegetables. Enjoy your culinary exploration on Lošinj!"
